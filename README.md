# Mustafa Fool — Portfolio (GitHub Pages ready)

This package contains an `index.html` and an `images/` folder with all assets.
To publish on GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `mustafafool.github.io`).
2. Clone it locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   ```
3. Copy contents of this folder into the repository root (index.html and images folder).
4. Commit and push:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio upload"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. On GitHub, go to *Settings > Pages* and enable Pages from the `main` branch (root).
   Or name repository `<username>.github.io` and it will publish automatically.

That's it — your portfolio will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/` within a few minutes.
